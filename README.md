# 462-individual-project
In this project, we will use MATLAB to perform SLAM work. We divide the entire process into two major steps. In the first step, we will conduct a step-by-step analysis of the data set provided by the TUM RGB-D benchmark, and then we will test ourselves from data collection to the improvement of the estimated trajectory. Here we will show the code execution of each part and the corresponding results. For running the code of this project, our MATLAB needs to install the following additional toolboxes: Computer Vision Toolbox and MATLAB Coder. These two toolboxes can be downloaded directly through the MATLAB toolbox search.
I will put the progress of these two parts into two separate project reports to clearly express my understanding and gains from each part.
Please check these two project reports for details.
